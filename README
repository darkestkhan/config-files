Those are config files and scripts that I'm (quite extensively) using. 
Including installation script if someone would like to use them 
(lookout - it is removing existing config files).
 I hope they will be of some for you. 
And one more thing - make-install.sh was made because I was too lazy to
manually copy files.

Scripts:
  bin/vlc_flood_preventer.sh 
I have found that under heavy loads vlc has really hateful tendency to
literally flood memory. Nothing nicer than script killing it before it
kills system. :)
